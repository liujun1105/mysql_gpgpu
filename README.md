===========
The aim of this project is to study the possibility of accelerating traditional relational database management 
systems (RDBMS) with GPU devices. The project investigates the potential benefit that a GPU device can bring to the RDBMS.

In this project, we have implemented a set of GPU-based aggregation operators for MySQL database.
